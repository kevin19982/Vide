For some matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from that proceeding. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. of NA is As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2022, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate.

For example, we tested controls over the Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures. . the (Amounts in millions, except per share data) of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 2022 . the (Amounts in millions, except per share data) of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 2021 . the (Amounts in millions, except per share data) of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 2020 . the Membership and other income of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 4,992 . the Membership and other income of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 3,918 . the Membership and other income of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 4,038 . the Total revenues of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 572,754 . the Total revenues of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 559,151 . the Total revenues of Fiscal Years Ended January 31, is 523,964 .

("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings . Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers . Each week, we serve approximately 230 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 46 banners in 24 countries . Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage . Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time . By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP") . EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity . Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers . Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club . Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations . We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis . Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021") and January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") . During fiscal 2022, we generated total revenues of $572.8 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $567.8 billion . We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas . Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT." The Development of Our Company The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M . Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas . In 1946, his brother, James L . Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri . Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores . In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter . In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market . In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2022, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 23 countries . In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com . Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow . In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores . To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and 6,000 delivery locations globally . In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers . These investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings . We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform . We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.3 million associates as of January 31, 2022 to better serve our customers . Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination . In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members . As we execute on our strategy, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, our health and wellness business, including Walmart Health, and our financial services business . These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience . 6 Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico . We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures . Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below . Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently . However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Walmart U.S .

Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues . Operations .

Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S . continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences . Seasonal Aspects of Operations . Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns . Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . Competition . Walmart U.S . competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services . Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition . Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition . They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses . In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us . Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry . We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations . We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry . These strategies include the following: •EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; •EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; •Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and •Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services . Distribution . We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S . For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers . General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise . We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores . Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S . as of January 31, 2022 . Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) . Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of 8 Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures . Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale . These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites . Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively . The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S . primarily because of its format mix . Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates . We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth . As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years: •Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020 . •Divestiture of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021 . •Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021 . Omni-channel . Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India . Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers . A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity . Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet . Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet . As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900 delivery locations . Merchandise . The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S . in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale . While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S . private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items . Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Extra Special," "Lider," "Myntra," and "PhonePe." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices . Walmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various markets . Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising . Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues . Operations . The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation . Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences . Seasonal Aspects of Operations . Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent . Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year . The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns . Competition . Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses . Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry . We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach . Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate . Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition . Some of our competitors have longer histories 9 in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition . They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses . In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us . Distribution . We utilize a total of 179 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa . Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment . During fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities . Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate . Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live . We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 83 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,400 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores . Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S . and in Puerto Rico . Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com . Sam's Club had net sales of $73.6 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 2022 net sales, and had net sales of $63.9 billion and $58.8 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively . As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income .

Additionally, most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 8:00 a.m . Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience . Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members . Sam's Club also offers "Scan & Go," a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line . 10 Seasonal Aspects of Operations . Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns . Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . Competition . Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses . At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members . Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete . Distribution . We utilize 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S . segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items . During fiscal 2022, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers . Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 12 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers . Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs . The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs . Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights . We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S . and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights . Additionally, we have filed U.S . and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology . We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties . Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S . and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online . In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category . We offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us . These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers . Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws . Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members . Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions . For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A . Risk Factors" under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks." Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities . We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on . We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact . Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity . 11 •Opportunity . Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity . We aim to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to provide opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section below), our supply chain and the communities we're in to fulfill our customer mission, strengthen our business and help people build a better life for themselves and their families . •Sustainability . Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both people and planet . With respect to people, our sustainability efforts focus on sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products . With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste . To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative . •Community . Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives . •Ethics and Integrity . At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our associates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve . We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to time . Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Human Capital Management Our commitment to help people around the world save money and live better is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our customers every day . As of the end of fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 2.3 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.7 million associates in the U.S . and approximately 0.6 million associates internationally . In the U.S., approximately 94% of these associates are hourly and approximately 69% are full-time . We believe the strength of our workforce, our associates, is a significant contributor to our success . Walmart is a place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in their careers across our global omni-channel business . As customer expectations and technology change the nature of work, we are focused on attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining associates to thrive in an ever-changing environment . Approximately 75% of our U.S . salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions . Our focus on providing a path of career opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and opportunities for advancement creates a strong associate value proposition . The COVID-19 pandemic and the related reassessment taking place across the workforce had an impact on our retention of associates and as a result turnover in the U.S . increased compared to the previous fiscal year . Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: Inclusion - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse associate base . Creating an environment where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to be themselves, which we believe is essential in serving our customers now and in the future . We publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors . Of the approximately 2.3 million associates employed worldwide, 53% identify as women . In the U.S., 49% of the approximately 1.7 million associates identify as people of color . We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices . We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do . To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an anonymous, periodic associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions . Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey . Feedback and suggestions received through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business . Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates . We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements, and we believe these investments in our associates are important to our future . In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, 12 maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral health services, and a store discount card or Sam's Club membership . Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website . Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements . The health and safety of our associates remain our biggest priorities and we continue to focus on enabling access to vaccines, providing safeguards within facilities, and supporting associates . We encourage all associates to consider the COVID-19 vaccine and provide access to make the decision easier . Associates can become vaccinated while on the clock or receive paid time off to do so . Our COVID-leave policy, which was implemented in March 2020 to support associates during the pandemic, has been extended through March 31, 2022 . Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills . We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success . We invest in associate development – including new roles and career paths, cross-training, on-the-job learning and coaching, and formal, classroom-style training such as Walmart Academy in the U.S . We also provide access to educational opportunities for our eligible associates through our Live Better U program, which provides a pathway to earn a high school diploma or a college degree at no cost, as well as multiple digital learning opportunities . Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance . As more customers shop digitally, we have adapted by adding more roles in eCommerce fulfillment and our home office associates have accelerated tech-based solutions that enhance the customer and associate experiences . 13 Information About Our Executive Officers The following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors .

Any such description will be located on our website for a period of 12 months following the amendment or waiver.The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity . Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S . and globally . The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face . Strategic Risks Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance . The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping . As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate . Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings . The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall flywheel strategy . The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . With the interconnected components of this flywheel strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets . In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance . Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term . If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business . It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns . The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment . Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products . Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns 15 could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business . We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance . Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services . The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive pressures . In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us . We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations . A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance . See "Item 1 . Business" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments . Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors . Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions . Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance . General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance . General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance . Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S . or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S . or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets . In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S . and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results . The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale . The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance . We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business . These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could 16 have achieved in the absence of such alliance . In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance . Operational Risks The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations continues to be unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future . The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile in light of the potential for a resurgence of infection rates or as a result of future mutations, variants, or related strains of the virus . Recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of the pandemic on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things . Customer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic . In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand . These factors may result in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future . Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for COVID-19 or other variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors . These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance . The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth . These results, as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods . Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations . To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S . and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements . Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance . The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S . stores), in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance . Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability 17 or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities . Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable . Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates . Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs . We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events . These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance . Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance . The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers . Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance . We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct . Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S . Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control . In addition, the U.S . foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control . These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance . If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance . We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms . Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products . Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control . Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims . As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance . In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions . Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position . In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others . Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements . Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy . 18 We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business . Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations . Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems . Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security incidents and breaches (through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities . Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations . Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities . If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim . Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations . In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems . The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken . If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives . If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected . Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping . We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience . As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs . Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world . We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment . Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations . Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks . Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business . If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business . Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results . Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors . Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses . In addition, we and our third-party service providers store and maintain health-related personal information, pharmacy, and medical records in connection with our health and wellness and pharmacy business . We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions . Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or 19 vendors . In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments . Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent . Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, phishing incidents . We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future . Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise . We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions . Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us . The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces . Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future . Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems . Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security . Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations . Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs . To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others . Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk . Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis . In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity . Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies . Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations . We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications . As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard . We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future . In certain circumstances, our contracts with 20 payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial . Additionally, through various financial service partners, we offer money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending, and earned wage access . These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations . Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation . The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches . Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media . Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation . Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity . Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S . and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health locations in a number of states which offer medical, dental, optometry, immunizations, and other health services . A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs") . These operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business . If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals . Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies . One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity . Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance . Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally . Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while 21 controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations . Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success . If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected . In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected . Financial Risks Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock . We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results . Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock . Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations . Our operations in countries other than the U.S . are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries . Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S . dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S . from local currencies into U.S . dollars using exchange rates for the current period . In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations . As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates . Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations . We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold . When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit . Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations . Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance . In addition to our U.S . operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico . During fiscal 2022, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales . Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries . Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control . These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently 22 underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future . The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance . Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S . and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S . Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S . The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S . generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations . In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S . laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries . We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations . Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S . laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations . Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation . Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance . In fiscal 2022, our Walmart U.S . and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net sales . Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S . and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance . A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S . stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries . Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S . operations and our business . We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S . and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated . The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation . Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles . We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision . The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations . In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S . corporations . As further guidance is issued by the U.S . Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance . Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations . In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules . These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes . The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate . Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation . Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial 23 Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made . Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance . We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S . and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations . Our operations in the U.S . are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness operations . The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Affordable Care Act; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S . Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the "DEA"); trade regulations including those of the U.S . Federal Trade Commission, the U.S . Department of the Treasury, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels and stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture); anti-kickback laws; anti-money laundering laws; consumer financial protection laws; the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse, quality and standards of medical equipment, and the qualifications and practice of the professions of medical, pharmacy, optical care and health care services . For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances . We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances . The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations . In addition, other health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations . Also, upon the successful completion of the previously announced pending acquisitions by our fintech joint venture, there may be an increased degree of scrutiny by financial regulatory authorities over the newly acquired fintech related businesses, which may result in higher operational costs and an increased possibility for fines and penalties if there is non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations . We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S . Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report . In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and U.S . sanctions . We are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in 2021 in Virginia and Colorado, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and China's Personal Information Protection Act . The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply . In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year . These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach . Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used . The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches . Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer 24 Protection Act . We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business . Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us . The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation . If we fail to respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected . While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations, enforcement priorities of regulatory authorities, and regulator discretion . The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks . We may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations . To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or criminal and civil penalties . Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S . or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations . We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity . We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment . We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities . We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested . Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive . Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years . For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws . The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No . 2804) currently pending in the U.S . District Court for the Northern District of Ohio . Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs . Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement . On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S . District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S . Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the U.S . Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA") . The Company's action was dismissed . The Company appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit . On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action . On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA . The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief . The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021 . Since that time, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v . United States, 142 S . Ct . 457 (2021) . In addition, the Company is the subject of a consolidated securities class action alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020 . On May 11, 2021 the U.S . District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel . The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022 . 25 Two derivative actions were also filed by certain of the Company's shareholders in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of the Company's current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids, and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters . Other shareholders filed a third derivative action making similar allegations in the Delaware Court of Chancery on September 27, 2021 . The defendants in this derivative suit filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022 . The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters . We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3 . Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity . Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery . The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons . Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations . While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder . Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals . We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas . From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues . We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time . Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our efforts . Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support.None . 26United States The Walmart U.S . and Sam's Club segments comprise the Company's operations in the U.S .

Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA") . The Company's action, Walmart Inc . v . U.S . Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist . of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed . The Company had appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit .

Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants . The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids . Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S . District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters . The other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware . The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020 .

CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: Asda Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal) . Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent . The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020 . The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government's investigation . The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent . While the Company had been engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter, the parties have not been able to reach a resolution . In November 2021, the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection forwarded a draft civil complaint to the FTC seeking authority to file a complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief . The FTC is currently considering whether to grant such authorization . The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters at this time . While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected . Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart . The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018 . The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice . If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief . Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously . Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings . While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected . III . ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million . In June 2021, the Company signed a tolling agreement with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California to toll the statute of limitations for potential claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous . In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous . The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter . While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million . Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.Not applicable . 31 PART IIMarket for Common Stock The principal market on which Walmart's common stock is listed for trading is the New York Stock Exchange . The common stock trades under the symbol "WMT." Holders of Record of Common Stock As of March 16, 2022, there were 209,870 holders of record of Walmart's common stock . Stock Performance Chart This graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Walmart's common stock during the five fiscal years ended through fiscal 2022 to the cumulative total returns on the S&P 500 Retailing Index and the S&P 500 Index . The comparison assumes $100 was invested on February 1, 2017 in shares of our common stock and in each of the indices shown and assumes that all of the dividends were reinvested.Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors . All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022 . On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program . As of January 31, 2022, authorization for $10.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program . Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status . 32 Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs, on a trade date basis, for each month in the quarter ended January 31, 2022, was as follows:(1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been repurchased at the end of the month.33Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021") and January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes . We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes . We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance . Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole . Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures . Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures . From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker . Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year . Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales . We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs . Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent . Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months . Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry . The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry . As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies . In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S . dollar into U.S . dollars . We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates . Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months . Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations . Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future . We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including the following highlights over the last three years: •In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses . Refer to Note 12 . •In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction . Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 . •In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction . Refer to Note 12 . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve . We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses . Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence . We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates . We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, 34 general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment . Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A . Risk Factors." We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus measures; effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatment; supply chain disruptions; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results . For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below . Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs . At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate . We define our financial framework as: •strong, efficient growth; •consistent operating discipline; and •strategic capital allocation . As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time . Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs . At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company . Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year . The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar) . To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases . However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar . Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2022 and 2021, were as follows:Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 7.7% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . Walmart U.S . comparable sales increased 6.4% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years . In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets . Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed . For fiscal 2021, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips . Walmart U.S . eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% and 5.4% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales increased 15.0% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . For fiscal 2022, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years . The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations . Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales . Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 2.2% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . 35 Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve . We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs . We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses.For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S . segment . For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales, offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic . Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings . The following table provides additional detail:Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time . We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics . We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section . Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S . ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets . While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets . Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts . ROA was 5.6% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . ROI was 14.9% and 14.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which increased primarily due to the increase in operating income . We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period . We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period . Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure . For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI . As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI . ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain 36 expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital . Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA . Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI . As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI . The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure . Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance . Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity . See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities . We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period . We had net cash provided by operating activities of $24.2 billion, $36.1 billion and $25.3 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . We generated free cash flow of $11.1 billion, $25.8 billion and $14.6 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages . Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures . Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments . Free cash flow for 37 fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in decreased capital expenditures . Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions . Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow . As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow . The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.(1) "Net cash used in investing activities" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow . Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations(1) Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the U.K . and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022 . Permanently closed locations are not included . Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $13.6 billion or 2.4% and $35.2 billion or 6.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $12.5 billion or 2.3% and $35.3 billion or 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S . and Sam's Club segments which benefited from strong U.S . consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets . The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K . and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022 . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S . and Sam's Club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic . Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic . The net sales increase was partially offset by a negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion . Our gross profit rate increased 14 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S . segment driven by cost 38 inflation as well as merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher margin categories, and fewer markdowns . This was partially offset in the Walmart U.S . segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S . segment . For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales, offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic . Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . Other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $3.0 billion and a net gain of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . The loss in fiscal 2022 primarily reflects net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of certain international operations which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . The gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects $8.7 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $8.3 billion pre-tax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021 . Our effective income tax rate was 25.4% for fiscal 2022, 33.3% for fiscal 2021, and 24.4% for fiscal 2020 . The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, and the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit . Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S . operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S . statutory rate . The reconciliation from the U.S . statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in Note 9 . As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $13.9 billion and $13.7 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents an increase of $0.2 billion and a decrease of $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $4.87, $4.75 and $5.19 for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Walmart U.S . SegmentNet sales for the Walmart U.S . segment increased $23.3 billion or 6.3% and $29.0 billion or 8.5% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 6.4% and 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively . Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years . In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets . Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed . Comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips . Walmart U.S . eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% and 5.4% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Gross profit rate increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022 and was flat for fiscal 2021, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year . The increase in fiscal 2022 gross profit rate was primarily due to price management driven by cost inflation as well merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and 39 growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs . Gross profit rate for fiscal 2021 benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, but was offset by a change in merchandise mix, the carryover effect of prior price investment and the temporary closure of our Auto Care and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year . Despite the strong sales growth described above, fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion . For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, and expanded cleaning practices . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $2.5 billion and increased $1.7 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . Walmart International SegmentNet sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $20.4 billion or 16.8% and increased $1.2 billion or 1.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion . The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets . While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021 . Gross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K . Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K . and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a $0.4 billion non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020 . Operating income for fiscal 2022 included a $0.3 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and fiscal 2021 included a $0.2 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . 40 Sam's Club Segment(1) We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices . Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future . Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment . Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0% . Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years . The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations . Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7% . Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales . Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales . Gross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales . For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs . Membership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration . For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration . Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales . Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves . Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year . Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity . Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations . Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases . We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future . 41 Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $24.2 billion, $36.1 billion and $25.3 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments . Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $14.8 billion and $17.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $6.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases . We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible . Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S . Historically, U.S . taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings . Due to the enactment of U.S . tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S . federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes . While we are currently evaluating recent regulations issued from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S . Treasury Department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S . to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S . due to local laws or other restrictions . Of the $4.3 billion as of January 31, 2022, approximately $2.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized by Flipkart . Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $6.0 billion, $10.1 billion and $9.1 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures . Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, partially offset by increased capital expenditures . Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures . Capital expenditures Refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2022 and 2021 . For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion, with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology . Net Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesNet cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock . Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities . Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year . The increase is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment 42 of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by new long-term debt issuances in the current year and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock . Fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.8 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year . The increase was primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings as well as share repurchases . Sale of Subsidiary Stock During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75% . Short-term Borrowings We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements . The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 2.9% and 1.9%, respectively . We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S . as of January 31, 2022 that provide additional liquidity, if needed . Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S . to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed . As of January 31, 2022, we have $1.8 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.7 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation . Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2022:Our total outstanding long-term debt decreased $6.6 billion during fiscal 2022, primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2021 . Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the maturities, extinguishment and issuances of long-term debt . The early extinguishment of certain long-term debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . In connection with this early extinguishment of debt, the Company paid premiums of $2.3 billion, which represents the majority of the $2.4 billion loss recorded on the transaction during fiscal 2022 . Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $16.0 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2023 . Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2022 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments . Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.2 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.0 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Effective February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share . For fiscal 2023, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.56 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: 43Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors . All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022 . On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program . As of January 31, 2022, authorization for $10.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program . Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status . We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock . We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow . In fiscal 2023, we plan to spend at least $10 billion in share repurchases . The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations . Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations . See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively . As of January 31, 2022, the Company has $27.9 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $9.3 billion is due within one year . Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts . Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction . Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above . Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements . Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods . We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty . Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations . Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases . We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets . As of January 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: 44Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time . Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time . Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy . Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us . In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing . The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities . Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating . Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies .

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology . In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S . These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements . These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes . Actual results may differ from our estimates . Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements . Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements . Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for Walmart U.S . segment's inventories . The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method . When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end . Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices . As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out ("FIFO") . 45 Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable . Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance . The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level . The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics . Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period . These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets . Impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 . As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2022 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment . In fiscal 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, the United Kingdom and Japan met the held for sale criteria . As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion recorded in fiscal 2021, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental charges associated with the United Kingdom and Japan divestitures upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . Refer to Note 12 . Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition . The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available . For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method . Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives . The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill . Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition . Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics . As of January 31, 2022, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club . Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired . Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary . If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed . The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions . These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach . Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value . Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost . Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted . Due to certain strategic restructuring decisions, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software . Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings . We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable . We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued . If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements . We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made . Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows . 46 Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings . We are subject to income taxes in the U.S . and numerous foreign jurisdictions . Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws . Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S . and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S . statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result . Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions . The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities . When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate . We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements . This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items . Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years . Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards . Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized . Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors . The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies . This evaluation relies on estimates . As guidance is issued by the U.S . Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments . The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes . The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption . In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities . Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt . We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps . For fiscal 2022, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.2 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates . The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates . For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates . For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted . The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts . The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2022 . 47(1) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt . As of January 31, 2022, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-term and long-term debt . Based on January 31, 2022 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion . Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt . For fiscal 2022, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $0.6 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss . We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps . The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $1.0 billion and $0.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively . The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S . dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2022 . The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S . dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $1.0 billion . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2022 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $40 million . In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies . Investment Risk We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values . The change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to net decreases in the stock price of those equity investments . As of January 31, 2022, the fair value of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values was $11.9 billion . As of January 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.2 billion . 48Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc .

Rogers, Arkansas March 18, 2022 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc . Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) . In our opinion, Walmart Inc . (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria . We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc . as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated March 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon . Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit . We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S . federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB .

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion . Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements . Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 18, 2022 52 Walmart Inc .

("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce . Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers . The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club . Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), January 31, 2021 ("fiscal 2021") and January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") . Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation . Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation . The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations . Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method . These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements . The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations . The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year . There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2022 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements . Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S . generally accepted accounting principles . Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities . Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . Actual results may differ from those estimates . Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents . All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents . The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $4.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world . Of the Company's $14.8 billion and $17.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, approximately 50% and 40% were held outside of the U.S., respectively . Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S . are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S . operations . The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S . due to local laws or other restrictions . Of the $4.3 billion as of January 31, 2022, approximately $2.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") minority shareholders . Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions . As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, net receivables from transactions with customers were $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively . 58 Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for the Walmart U.S . segment's inventories . The inventory for the Walmart International segment is generally valued in most markets by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method . The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory . The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out ("FIFO") . Held for Sale Components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell . The Company reviews its businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values . As of January 31, 2022, assets and liabilities held for sale were immaterial . As of January 31, 2021, $19.2 billion assets held for sale and $12.7 billion liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, reflecting the Company's operations in the U.K . and Japan classified as held for sale which subsequently closed during fiscal 2022 . Refer to Note 12 for additional details . Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost . Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred . Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred . The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term . Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $10.7 billion, $11.2 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively . Leases For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease . The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease . If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments . Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option . The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less . For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components . For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance . 59 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level . Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections . If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique . Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired . Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset . Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired . Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided . Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition . Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics . As of January 31, 2022, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club . Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units . Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary . If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required . The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units . Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches . Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill . The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2022 and 2021:(1) Represents goodwill associated with operations in the U.K . and Japan which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021 . Refer to Note 12 . Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names . There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2022 or 2021 . During fiscal 2020, the Company incurred approximately $0.7 billion in impairment charges related to its intangible assets . Refer to Note 8 for additional information . Fair Value Measurement The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value . The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction . The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor . Refer to Note 8 for more information . Investments Investments in equity and debt securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets . Changes in fair value of equity securities measured on a recurring basis are recognized in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income . Refer to Note 8 for details . Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements 60 of Income . Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value with interest income recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income . As of January 31, 2022, the Company had $1.0 billion in debt securities classified as trading . Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception . As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the Company had $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal and tax indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum amount of potential future payments under these indemnities was $3.5 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2022 . Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis . The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments . On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations . To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability . Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt . Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks . The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives . Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty . The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies . The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets . The Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral . Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2022 and 2021 . In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge . If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings . Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings . Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date . Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities . Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt . All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S . GAAP . Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt . These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2023 to September 2031 . Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S . denominated debt . The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings . These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to January 2039 . 61 Net Investment Hedges Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations . Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss . The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss . Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K . and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4 . As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $3.3 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges . Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences") . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled . The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date . Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized . Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors . The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies . These sources of income rely on estimates . In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates . Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur . The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return . The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures . Revenue Recognition Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer . eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer . Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns . Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S . and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months . Membership fee revenue was $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, respectively . Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets . Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card . Gift cards in the U.S . and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely . Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates . While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed . Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period . Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed . Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . 62 Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers . Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs . Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures . Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold . Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above . As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S . and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses . Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S . and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit . Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . Advertising costs were $3.9 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S . dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date . Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss . The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S . dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements . Note 2 . Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period . Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards . The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:63 Note 3 . Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.8 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2022 and 2021 . Sale of Subsidiary Stock During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75% . Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company . The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans:The Walmart Inc . Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 . The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders . The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: •Restricted Stock Units . Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period . Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant . Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date . The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period . The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period . The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 3.8%, 4.4% and 4.9%, respectively . •Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units . Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment . Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount . Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets . The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period . The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period . The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4.2%, 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively . In addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued . Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above . 64 The following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units during fiscal 2022:(1) Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement . The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units: Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors . All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022 . On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program . Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status . The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock . The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:Note 4 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table provides the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: 65(1) Primarily includes the remeasurement of Asda Group Limited's ("Asda") pension benefit obligation subsequent to the cash contribution made by Asda in fiscal 2020 . Refer to Note 11 . (2) Includes a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $0.8 billion, for which there was no related income taxes, upon sale of the majority stake in Walmart Argentina . Refer to Note 12 . (3) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K . and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021 . Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, and the amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . Note 5 . Accrued Liabilities The Company's accrued liabilities consist of the following as of January 31, 2022 and 2021:(1)Accrued wages and benefits include accrued wages, salaries, vacation, bonuses and other incentive plans . (2)Self-insurance consists of insurance-related liabilities, such as workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . (3)Accrued non-income taxes include accrued payroll, property, value-added, sales and miscellaneous other taxes . (4)Liabilities held for sale as of January 31, 2021 relate to the Company's operations in Japan and the U.K . classified as held for sale . See Note 12 . (5)Other accrued liabilities includes items such as deferred membership revenue, interest, advertising, maintenance & utilities, and supply chain . 66 Note 6 . Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit . Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 2.9% and 1.9%, respectively . The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S . to support its commercial paper program and are summarized in the following table:(1) In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility as well as its five year credit facility . The committed lines of credit in the table above mature in April 2022 and April 2026, carry interest rates of LIBOR plus 50 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points . In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt . Additionally, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available which totaled $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, of which $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8, consists of the following as of January 31, 2022 and 2021:(1)The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates . (2)Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt . Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows:67 Debt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during fiscal 2022, for general corporate purposes and certain eligible green investment initiatives, is as follows:(1) Represents a green bond issuance for which an amount equal to the net proceeds is intended to fund certain eligible green investment initiatives through the maturity date of the bond . These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable . These issuances do not contain any financial covenants which restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock . There were no long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2021 . Maturities and Extinguishments The following table provides details of debt repayments during fiscal 2022:(1) Represents portion of the outstanding principal amount which was repaid during fiscal 2022 . Individual repayment amounts may not sum due to rounding . 68 The Company recorded a $2.4 billion loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal 2022, which included payment of $2.3 billion in early extinguishment premiums . The following table provides details of debt repayments during fiscal 2021:Note 7 . Leases The Company leases certain retail locations, distribution and fulfillment centers, warehouses, office spaces, land and equipment throughout the U.S . and internationally . The Company's lease costs recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income consist of the following:Other lease information is as follows:The aggregate annual lease obligations at January 31, 2022, are as follows:69 Note 8 . Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value . The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: •Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; •Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and •Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions . As described in Note 1, the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets . The fair values of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows:Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value . Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates . The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves . As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:(1)Primarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets . (2)Primarily classified in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets . Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements . Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges . Upon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income . Refer to Note 12 . The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2022 . For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K . met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12 . As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration . The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K . disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges . The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021 and included these impairment charges as well as a $2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan . These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups . Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial . 70 For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarily related to the following: •in the Walmart U.S . segment, $0.5 billion in impairment charges for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed software due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and •in the Walmart International segment, $0.4 billion in impairment charges consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform . These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income . Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020 were immaterial . Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost . The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities . The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost . The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements . The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:Note 9 . Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows:A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows:71 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S . statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations is as follows:The following sections regarding deferred taxes, unremitted earnings, net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions exclude amounts related to operations classified as held for sale . Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows:The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets:72 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested . As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S . tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S . federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes . As of January 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded approximately $3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S . and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation . Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2022, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $39.3 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately $26.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2042 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration . The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies . To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established . To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income . The Company had valuation allowances of $9.5 billion and $8.8 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards . Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2022 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets . Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities . As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively . The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively . Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 . During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance . The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible . As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months . The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements . The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S . federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014, and 2018 through 2022 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2022, and for U.S . state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2022 . With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S . federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013 . 73 Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes . A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions . In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations . Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements . Note 10 . Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters . The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements . For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made . However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed . The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders . Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows . Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse . The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No . 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S . District Court for the Northern District of Ohio . The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation . The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims . On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company . The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts owed by the defendants, is currently scheduled to begin on May 10, 2022 . The Company intends to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial . Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs . Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement . The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously . The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids . On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S . District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S . Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the U.S . Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA") . The Company's action was dismissed . The Company had appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit . On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action . On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies . The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA . The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief . The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021 . The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021 . On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two consolidated cases (not involving Walmart) interpreting the CSA . In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020 . Those cases have been consolidated . On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022 . Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S . District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures . Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other Opioids 74 Litigation matters . On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business . The defendants filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022 . The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters . Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected . Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the "Asda Equal Value Claims"), and further claims may be asserted in the future . Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims . While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount . The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings . Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters . Note 11 . Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S . under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire . The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment . Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings . The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate . Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits . Associates in international countries who are not U.S . citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements . These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established . The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:Additionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan . In fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the "Plan") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion to the Plan (the "Asda Pension Contribution") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future obligations . In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $2.3 billion were included in the disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8 and Note 12 . 75 Note 12 . Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following disposals impact the Company's Walmart International segment . Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced . Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion . Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing . During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Asda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 . Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss . In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs . Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion . Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing . During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Seiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 . Assets and liabilities held for sale associated with the Asda and Seiyu disposal groups as of January 31, 2021 were as follows:(1)Includes inventories, receivables, net and prepaid expenses and other .

(3)Includes accounts payable and accrued liabilities . Walmart Argentina In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina . As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group . 76 Note 13 .

In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives . Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures . Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities . Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries . In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment . Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls . These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting . However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective . An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms . Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting . Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements . Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2022 .
